#include <iostream>
$$ This includes the iostream library, which basically allows you to output stuff to the terminal

using namespace std;
$$ This globally defines a 'namespace.' This means that future commands are expected to come from the std, or 'standard' library.

int main(){
$$ Starts the main function. Every program in c++ must have a main function. Don't forget it. 

    // This prints stuff out
$$ Commenting is important for people to understand your code

    cout << "hello world." << endl;
$$ This is your first code. It prints out 'hello world' to the terminal. Good job!
}

$$ Note the spacing after starting the main function. It's not necesarry, but people do it anyway to the code is easier to read.
