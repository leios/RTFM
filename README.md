A programming game

------

Here's the idea: Programming is fun. Let's teach it right!

The overall premise is simple. We let people create their character, which will just be a moniker, then we send them on a programming adventure, starting with terminal usage, then moving on to a series of choices in a "world map." 
Players will choose programming languages like they would choose a class in RPG games, and their afdventure will be tailored based on this choice. 
They can obviously change their programming language whenever they want and many of the quests are not language-specific, so it only matters for a few select quests. 

The goal is to provide an application that takes users who know nothing at all about programming and actually teaches them everything they would ever need to know to become a developer in whatever field they want. 

This will lead to several quest lines, like maybe one for becoming a web developer or another for becoming a researcher. 
When they finish that line, they should be able to actually work as a web developer or researcher in that field (of course, there are some real-world qualifications that must happen for most jobs).

What is the game going to look like? Well, I'm going to make a terminal application. Other people can make a gui, if they want. 
At the start, there will just be a world map; however, I might later add in a pokemon-style adventure, where the goal is to collect a certain number of trophies while learning certain numerical techniques.

This may end up becoming a large project. 
I only have a little expertise and it's very specific. If this is meant to be a general tool, there will need to ba multiple hands on the project, creating multiple quest lines.

That's all for now. I will begin writing the code in the "beta" branch. 
I will add a text file helping people write the quest lines when the time comes.
For now, I need to get the underlying system in place and go from there.
